# Sudmodules
Submodules allow you to keep a Git repository as a subdirectory of another Git repository. This lets you clone another repository into your project and keep your commits separate.

Adding a submodule:
`git submodule add https://github.com/example/foo.git`

Deleting a submodule from current folder.

`git rm <folder>`
